The dorm chairs at Williams are an essential piece of furniture for every student.
Students use this chair in front of their desk to mainly do work, or as a seat
when people are in the room. I personally always do my take-home examinations
sitting on this chair. This is because of its great design features. Its
base has a curvature to it that allows whoever is sitting on it to lean back.
I mostly use this when I am pondering on a problem or when I am lost in my thoughts.
Being able to lean back is essential to my thinking. The chair is made out of
sturdy wood, so that one can feel fully comfortable and secure on the chair. I
propped the chair up on my bed and on the floor to hang flags and posters on my
wall. The chair is sturdy enough to hold my weight and allow me to be creative
with decoration. Even though it is made out of wood, the seat of the chair also
has a dent that allows one to sit comfortably. On top of this, the back of the
chair is molded to fit people's back and it is sturdy enough to maintain good posture.
